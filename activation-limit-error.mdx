### Why this error occurs?

When user uninstalls app without unlinking the license key from the app, the license key stays activated on the previous version of the app. we can't unlink the license key automatically when user uninstalls apps so user has to do it manually from lemonsqueezy orders page.

### How to solve this error?

1. Go to lemonsqueezy orders page using the link below

[https://app.lemonsqueezy.com/my-orders](https://app.lemonsqueezy.com/my-orders)
